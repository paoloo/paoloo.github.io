This is my personal space. I am a <b>researcher</b> and <b>system engineer</b> with a passion for technology,
science, and travel. Here you can find my blog posts, academic work, and travel experiences. Feel free to explore
and get in touch!<br/>

My <a href="blog/">Blog</a> is mostly my notes about tech that I experiment with, but I also write about science
and travel. You can also check out my <a href="academics/">Academics</a> page for my research work and publications. They
are also available on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gaUnn5oAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>,
