# COVID-19 and Blogging again


Things have been crazy for quite a while and I had no time (at all) to organize my thoughts (or my life).
I've been walking weird paths but I'm finally finding some sort of light(maybe, idk).

The point is: I'll try to write more often. I've been learning so many new things and there is a lot to assimilate, document and describe. After all, this is the time when I sit down and think about what I've really learnt, what is useful, and so on.

I returned to github because it's simpler (and I forgot about the ssh instance which I stored everything, losing a lot of time to regain access and this is pure bullshit ).

So yeah, new journey, and I hope everything goes well
