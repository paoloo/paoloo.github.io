My current stop is one of the most beautiful and amazing cities of the world: Budapest! I came from Berlin and took me 12 hours in a bus but hell, it worthed. The city is amazing, really really beautiful, everyone speaks english and, what really matters: there is a HUGE amount of cafés and wifi almost everywhere. There is some coworkings around the city but, as always, I decided to work on cafés but, with 4G, it&#8217;s OK to work from any park. Just remember that district V/Inner City is safe if you are not a dumb tourist but the party districts(VI and VII) are not, so be careful.

I&#8217;ve been working on 4 places in this city.

The first one, **the Ahoy! Café**. You will find an amazing food and an acceptable coffee. The internet speed is arount **60MB** but if it is full, you gonna have connection issues eventually. There are some power plugs around and the place is not too noisy or expensive.

The second place I&#8217;ve been was **Zërgë Coffeeshop**, the breakfast was really amazing, the coffees were better than expected but my gratest surprise was the stable **120MB** internet. The place is small, have a great soundtrack, some power plugs and I found it on my morning walk from Pest to Buda near Chain bridge. If I need a fast place to make a call or solve I problem and be on Buda side, I&#8217;ll run to it for sure.

The third one is a english tea house: **Big Ben Teaház**, silent, with great teas, internet was just arount **20Mb** but was so relaxing that worth the time and money spend. I could focus and code a lot of things while having a delicious tea!

The fourth place was the lifesaver: starbucks! Yeah, coffee sucks but this is a place with familiar taste and stable internet connection. I could work a lot and be on skype meetings with no surprise.

Overall, Budapest is a must go city for anyone and, along with Prague, my personal passion. I recomend anyone come, live like a local and work from here. (side note: true hungarian food from city market almost killed me of diarrhea. It&#8217;s tasty but eat it carefully!)
