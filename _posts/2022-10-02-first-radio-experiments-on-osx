After installing GNUradio, there are some other tools to properly start experimenting on RF. One of the more versatiles ones is: [fldigi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fldigi/)!

I installed it with [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and it's pretty straightforward: `brew install fldigi`

We also need a hardware to connect a standard transceiver to the computer. Usually an USB sound card+USB-to-serial is enough but we have better options like [digirig](https://digirig.net)!

I did try to attach a baofeng uv5r to fldigi using digirig. The configuration is pretty simple: Select digirig usb sound card for rx and tx and, on Rig Control/Hardware PTT, set "use a separated serial", select the device and use RTS as the trigger.

It works like magic!

Next step is to talk to radio via python
