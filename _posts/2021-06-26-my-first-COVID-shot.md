yeah! I finally got my first shot of covid-19's vaccine. I've got the pfizer/biontech's mRNA one, which is awesome as its my first mRNA vaccine. it's great to have this kind of technology inside my veins. There is an amazing review of pfizer's vaccine on [Bert Hubert](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/)'s blog and it's the first vaccine that I have a 100% understanding of it's structure bofore having it injected.

I posted a [picture](https://twitter.com/paoloo/status/1409143396694888449) on my twitter profile showing the ["source code"](https://berthub.eu/articles/11889.doc) of the vaccing on my 80's MSX display while having the "compiled" vaccine on my vains haha

This thing is so great. I hope that we can use more mRNA vaccines on humans and this field gorws stronger to protect us from the future bizarreness.
