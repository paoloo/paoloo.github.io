Long story short, long ago I was a RF affictionado but time and other shenanigans changed my research focus. For many reasons, now is a good time to return. To be completely legal, I applied to an amateur radio license and now I have government authorization to properly experiment on the RF spectrum. I got my C class license under callsign PU7OLV.

I'm an etusiastic short wave listener and I love CW. I operate mostly packet on 2, 1.25, 0.7 and 0.33 meter bands on many modes. I've started to research antennas development for multiple bands and I really love it.
