I finally got a flipper zero! This thing is awesome!

I got the full package, with the <b>wifi dev board</b> and all the Kit(boards, protections, sd card).

I already cloned my doors, doorbell, hotel doors, parking tags and I just started to play with it. I have to research more and make more experiment.
