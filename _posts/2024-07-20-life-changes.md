In about 6 months my life changed so hard that I cannot even say that I'm the same person. A lot of bad things happened and I had to improvise.

I also changed jobs. I started to work as embedded engineer again, messing with Computer Vision on the edge, using raspberry pi 5 and the hailo-8 chip.

I'll stay in Europe for a while but I will return home as soon as possible. Meanwhile, I've been playing with RISC OS and C.
