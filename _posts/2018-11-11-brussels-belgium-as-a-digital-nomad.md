This is tricky, I had a very bad image of Brussels from scratch. The city looked like a dirty and weird 1970&#8217;s version of a developed city. Although I don&#8217;t really think I&#8217;ll return ever again(if I don&#8217;t really need to) there was some pretty good places to work like [Cafe le Coq](https://www.facebook.com/CafeLeCoq/) and [Corica grand place](https://corica.be/en/location/corica-brussel-2223) (good selection of coffees, amazing taste and great internet but there are no places to sit inside).

The internet is good but the city as a whole is not, at least from my point of view. So, if you really need to go, you will be able to work.

Some pictures of my wanderings around Brussels:
