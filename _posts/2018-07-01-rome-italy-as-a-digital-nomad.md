My current stop on this weird nomadic life is **Rome**, birth of Republic, home of Coloseum, Vatican city and a crazily overcrowded place! Rome is dirty, noisy and expensive, but is a place to go and understand the basis of western civilization. There is a growing startup moviment in rome since 2017 and it will be everytime more remote friendly but, you have pretty acceptable internet everywhere nowadays.

I haven&#8217;t even looked for coworking there, I worked on streets or bars, drinking some great capuccinos, and almost every bar/restaurant have good internet. As you can see in the picture below, I was working in front of pantheon, with a 40Mbps internet, solving some problems through ssh and **python**.

In Rome you can find great food(the roman plasta is amazing, amatriciana and carbonara are roman specials. And remember to drink wine from sicily, it&#8217;s delicious!) and the subway is kinda OK to use(cheap and easily inderstandable). Not the perfect place for a nomad as it is overcrowded and expensive but definitively a place to visit and stay for a while.

some pictures of my wandering around Rome:
