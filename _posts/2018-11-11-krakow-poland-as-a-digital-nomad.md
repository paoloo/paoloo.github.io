This is one of the best cities of the world to me. Krakow is the best of Poland and it is an amazing place to visit and travel. As a nomad, you can find internet and coffees pretty much everywhere, but not just that, good food and great people are an integral part of the city.

To work, as always, I looked for cafes. As I was on jewish neighbourhood, Kazimierz, I tried to find places around. Again, I was able to work on pretty much any restaurant or breakfast place but I have one favourite with great coffee and food, mazing internet, power plugs and space: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cheder.krakow/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cheder</a>

Also, I use to eat a lot on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KrakoskaCafeAndLunch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Krakoska</a>, it is a great place to work(power plugs, good internet, silence) although it doesn&#8217;t look like that.

A great note if you want something definitively different and cozy: an underground tea house in the heart of old market square, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Herbaciarnia-Czarka-487527657973842/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Herbaciarnia Czarka</a>

So, Krakow is not just a great place for a digital nomad, but a great place to live. Part of my heart will always be in Krakow. Go there and enjoy.
