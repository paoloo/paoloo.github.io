&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a seasoned system engineer and researcher, specializing in a diverse array of fields including computer security, hardware design, embedded systems, robotics, space hardware and data analysis. My research interests span embedded systems, industrial networks, communication protocols, RF, artificial intelligence, computer security, blockchain technology, bioinformatics and various aspects of aeroespace engineer. My expertise encompasses malware analysis, pentesting, data communication, radiofrequency, control theory, sensor data acquisition, digital filters, computer vision, path planning, ROS for drones, blockchain applications, simulations in bioinformatics, satellite communication and flight software.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With years of experience in backend, infrastructure, and security engineering across sectors such as power, payments, gaming, and healthcare, I've leveraged my skills in security, fault tolerance, real-time systems, automation, and architecture to enhance organizational resilience and efficiency. I'm a licensed radio amateur (**PU7OLV**), passionate about radio communication. Proficient in `C`, `C++`, `assembly(z80, x86, arm64)`, `Python`, `Erlang`, `Clojure`, `Ruby` and `Go`, I excel in software and hardware reverse engineering, and developing industrial communication protocols.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love coffee, it's my addiction. I've been traveling around the world working from coffeeshops.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have 3 crazy dogs that were rescued and they are always close by.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love classical computers(from 1980's and 1990's), specially the Z80 and m68k based ones, to enhance and modernize. I've been writing games for Sega genesis, MSX, C64 and NES. It's a wonderful experience.
