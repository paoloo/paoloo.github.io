Lately, I added Go as one of my favourite programming languages and I&#8217;ve tried to rewrite e create new projects in Go. Basically, the reasons Go became one of my favourite languages is that, although the language/compiler/tools is opensource, different from a majority of opensource projects (JS mainly), it is backed up by a huge corporation (Google) and is easy to avoid major mess (hello JS, my old friend). Also, Go is fast (really, really fast), simple (like C, not like python), concurrent and cross-platform by design, what makes Go a great general pourpose language. If all these previous reasons don&#8217;t catch your heart, Go is designed by Rob Pike and Ken Thompson, the same guys who designed UNIX and C, so there is no way this would be bad (fanboy attack?). Another very specific issue I had with c++ and libboost: take 3-8 hours compiling libraries whose Go version took 5 seconds, made me embrace Go as a friend.

I saw Go, from very begining, as a &#8220;pythonic C&#8221; and, for a python guy&#8217;s perspective, I loved it. And, being able to handle binary data just like C but structured data just like python, made me fall in love.

In the end, I started to use Go as a main language, I hope to gain more wisdom on it and become a better Gopher.
