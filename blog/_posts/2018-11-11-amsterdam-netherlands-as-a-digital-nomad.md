The sweet, crazy and beautiful Amsterdam. I love this place! The bridges, canals, bars, happy people and the idea of a real life sodoma, which it is far from true but is a great place to have fun. Not the best place to find internet suitable to work but you can always get a place with cheaper bear that you will be barely alone using the wifi.

I have worked from various places but my indication is the [Coffee De Dokter](https://www.cafe-de-dokter.nl), this pub from **1798** have an amazing draft beer and an OK internet but the environment is soberb, like a time capsule(and I was able to a skype call and even ssh from there).

Other than that, you will end up working on your hotel, because is pretty hard to stay sober in Amterdam. Believe me, I tried ;D
The last place, where I could do real job was, of course, Starbucks.

So, Amterdam is amazing and beautiful. Enjoy it any day in your life, you won&#8217;t regret!
